# Iceborn Origin - Origins (Fabric) For Minecraft 1.18
This is a comissioned Origin, its a VERY simple one so I really don't see the need to upload it or give it much detail as the others. But sometimes simple is useful so maybe I'll come back to this one in the future, who knows. But this Origin is very balanced overall.

Iceborn datapack is made for the fabric mod, [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You must have it for this pack to work.
